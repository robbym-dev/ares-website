  ARES (Automated RAG Evaluation System) simplifies evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. 
  It automates the assessment of context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance, eliminating 
  the need for extensive human annotations. ARES generates synthetic training data and fine-tunes lightweight 
  language models to provide accurate evaluations quickly and efficiently. 
  With ARES, you can ensure your RAG systems perform optimally with minimal effort. 
  Get started now to streamline your evaluation process and improve your RAG solutions.
